## Theme: It's Not Real

Angry Truffel Pigs

Player is a farmer who needs to get all his angry truffel pigs back in a pig sty. The Farmer has found a fake truffle that smells like exactly like a real truffel and his angry pigs love it.
The farmer must use the fake truffels to trick the pig into moving to the "Truffle". The pig will attack the farmer when he is too close. The farmer does not have any way to defend or attack the pig. It's his beloved pigs after all. The farmer can hide in a heap of hay to let the pigs "lose" him.
Lure all the pigs back into their sty to complete the level.
